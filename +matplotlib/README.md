MATPLOTLIB Colormap Package
===========================

Providing perceptually _**exact**_ sequential and cyclic continuous colormaps and nonmisleading qualitative colorscheme from `matplotlib`. More info can be found in [matplotlib official docs](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/colors/colormaps.html), or in the [original video presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAoljeRJ3lU) (a very enjoyable watch!).

## Overview of the imported colormaps ##

Note that the package delivers only a subset of all matplotlib's colorscheme, namely those that have been originally developed by its team. If you are looking for `Paired` or `RdBu`, etc... you might want to check the [BREWER](../%2Bbrewer/) colormap package. Same goes for [CubeHelix](../%2Bcubehelix/).

### Examples: ###

```matlab
    % View a PHOTO with matplotlib default colormap
    S = load('mandrill');
    imshow(S.X,colormap(matplotlib.viridis))
```
![mandrill_viridis](assets/mandrill_viridis.png)
```matlab
    % Graph a surface with the twilight cyclic colormap
    [X,Y,Z] = peaks(50);
    surfc(X,Y,Z)
    colormap(matplotlib.twilight_shifted) % shifted to have white at zero
```
![surfc_twilight](assets/surfc_twilight.png)
```matlab
    % Plot and compare RGB values:
    ax(1) = subplot(1,2,1);
    cmap = matplotlib.viridis;
    rgbplot(cmap); title('viridis'); 
    xlim([0,256]); xticks([]);
    colorbar('southoutside');
    colormap(ax(1),cmap); 

    ax(2) = subplot(1,2,2);
    cmap = matplotlib.plasma;
    rgbplot(cmap); title('plasma');
    xlim([0,256]); xticks([]);
    colorbar('southoutside');
    colormap(ax(2),cmap); 
```

```matlab
    % Multiline plot using matrices:
    N = 6;
    axes('ColorOrder',matplotlib.tab10,'NextPlot','replacechildren')
    X = linspace(0,pi*3,1000);
    Y = bsxfun(@(x,n)n*sin(x+2*n*pi/N), X.', 1:N);
    plot(X,Y, 'linewidth',4); box on; xlim([0,3*pi]);
```
![tab10](assets/tab10.svg)
```matlab
    % Multiline plot in a loop:
    set(0,'DefaultAxesColorOrder',matplotlib.tab20)
    N = 6;
    X = linspace(0,pi*3,1000);
    Y = bsxfun(@(x,n)n*sin(x+2*n*pi/N), X.', 1:N);
    for n = 1:N
        plot(X(:),Y(:,n), 'linewidth',4);
        hold all
    end
    xlim([0,3*pi]);
```
