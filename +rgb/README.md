RGB Colorname Package
=====================

Here we provide methods to retrieve rgb triplets, from two huge well-known datasets: the old Unix [X11/rgb.txt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X11_color_names) file and the impressive web-survey carried out by [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/color/rgb/). There is no bias here between the two (contrary to what happens in [matplotlib, which prioritizes X11 names](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/colors/colors.html#comparison-between-x11-css4-and-xkcd-colors)), as you can invoke respectively `rgb.X11('colorname')` and `rgb.xkcd('colorname')` to get colors from either the datasets. Both functions share the same API:

1. Both `rgb.X11('show')` and `rgb.xkcd('show')` will pop-up an html chart with all colors depicted, in window-based environments. On terminal it will just print all the colornames. Use `'list'` instead of `'show'` if you want an actual return of the list of colornames (as a cell array).
   
2. For whatever input other than `'show'` and `'list'` a powerful string-search engine will scan the selected database and either return the rgb triplet, for exact, case-insentive matches, or provide a list of 'nearest' (in string space!) matches. Try it, you'll find that the 'show' option is quite unuseful at the end of the day. ðŸ™ƒ

    ```matlab
    % EXAMPLE
    rgb.xkcd('blue-green')
    Color 'blue-green' not found in xkcd/rgb.
    Consider one of these options:
        {'greenblue' }
        {'bluegreen' }
        {'green/blue'}
        {'blue/green'}
        {'green blue'}
        {'blue green'}
    ```
   
3. Both functions accept not only single characater vectors, but also strings, cells of strings, multiple strings / character vectors. It's as general as possible: whatever valid collection of colornames should work fine.

For more detailed information and examples just invoke the docstrings by typing `help rgb.X11`, `help rgb.xkcd` (or use the `doc` command instead of `help` for a nicer pop-up window).
